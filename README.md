The codebase is related to two master's thesis projects at Lund University by Mohamed Abrash in Computational Science and Eric De Leon in Mathematical Statistics.

The *BO_Code folder* contains an implementation of Bayesian Optimization (BO).

The *LPJ-GUESS Optimization folder* contains various experiments that utilize the BO code to interface with and optimize the LPJ-GUESS model. The specific BO settings used in each experiment can be found in each of the files.
